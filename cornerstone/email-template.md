> Electronic mail (email or e-mail) is a method of exchanging messages ("mail") between people using electronic devices. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Email)]

## Why 

想要高效，清晰地写邮件，获得写邮件的最佳实践

## How

Do a CRABS check: 

* **Chunking**. Chunking means that paragraphs must be shorter than in paper copy. One or two short sentences max. This helps scannability.
* **Relevance**. With limited space, we have no room for fillers. Stick with what matters – the details of the offer and how to receive it.
* **Accuracy**. Don’t get carried away with your copy; don’t set expectations so high that you overpromise and can’t deliver something you offer.
* **Brevity**. Brevity goes with chunking and scannability. Write your copy, reduce the word count and then reduce it again. Give yourself targets and beat them without sacrificing good English and understanding.
* **Scannability**. This is reading without reading every word, just picking up the sense of each paragraph from the keywords. The eye will pick out words at the start of paragraphs and those emphasized in bold.
