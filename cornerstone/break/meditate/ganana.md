> Gaṇanā (Pali, "**counting**") is the technique of breath counting in Buddhist meditation. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ganana)]

## Why 

Those stages are increasingly subtle and lead to control of mind.

## How

The practitioner must fix the mind upon the i**nhalation and exhalation**, without giving consideration to the state of his body or mind, and count mentally his breaths from **one up to ten**. One must keep count of every number; if the mind becomes **distracted** at some point, one must count **anew** from the starting point until samadhi is accomplished enough to avoid error.

## What 

### overview

Gaṇanā (Pali, "**counting**") is the technique of breath counting in Buddhist meditation. It focuses on drawing mental attention to breathing by counting numerically inhalation and exhalation. It is **part of the six stages** of anapanasati described by Vasubandhu and Zhiyi, 

* composed by counting breath (ganana), 
* following the motions of the air flow (anugama), 
* stilling thought in the body (sthana or sthapana), 
* observing the elements of air (upalakshana), 
* transformation of the mind focused on the air (vivarthana) and 
* entering the path of vision (parisuddhi).

Those stages are increasingly subtle and lead to control of mind, producing samadhi in order to achieve vipassana.

In Zen buddhism, the art of breath counting is named sūsoku-kan (数息観, "number breath viewing"), although the word is used to refer to anapanasati in a general way.

### classifications

Asanga consideres breath counting to be apt for beginners to anapana, while advanced aspirants should be able to concentrate on breathing without counting. He cites four different classifications of the counting technique:

* Ekaika-ganana: when the practitioner breathes in, counts one; when he breathes out, counts two, and so on.
* Dvayaika-ganana: when he completes the cycle of breathing in and out, he counts one; upon completing it again, it counts two.
* Anuloma-ganana: he counts from one to ten and again from one.
* Pratiloma-ganana: starting from ten, he counts backwards to one and again from ten.
