## What 

### overview

The body scan meditation focuses attention on physical sensations in the body. 

The practice is completed by “scanning” one’s awareness through the entire body on a micro level. Attention is given to every inch of the body. The purpose of this practice is to **cultivate** the ability to **notice** what is being **experienced** in the body- this includes all of the systems of the body- bones, skin, internal organs, digestion, etc. 

This is a particularly useful practice to learn self-awareness about how **physical** experience is tied to **emotional** experience. For each emotion we experience, there is a way in which that emotion resides in the body, and by opening one’s attention to receiving this information, one can begin to learn how to better respond to physical and emotional cues and their interrelated cognition. 

You may notice a range of emotions during your practice, this is OK and expected, the important part of the practice is to stay connected and aware of your experience without judgement.
