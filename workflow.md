### Workflow improvement theories

Several workflow improvement theories have been proposed and implemented in the modern workplace. These include:

* Six Sigma
* Total Quality Management
* Business Process Reengineering
* Lean systems
* Theory of Constraints

Evaluation of resources, both physical and human, is essential to evaluate hand-off points and potential to create smoother transitions between tasks.

## What 

### Overview

A workflow consists of **an orchestrated and repeatable pattern** of activity, enabled by the systematic organization of resources into **processes** that **transform materials, provide services, or process information**. It can be depicted as a sequence of operations, the work of a person or group, the work of an organization of staff, or one or more simple or complex mechanisms.

From a more abstract or higher-level perspective, workflow may be considered a view or representation of real work. The flow being described may refer to a document, service, or product that is being transferred from one step to another.

Workflows may be viewed as one **fundamental building block** to be combined with other parts of an organization's structure such as **information technology**, **teams**, **projects** and **hierarchies**.
